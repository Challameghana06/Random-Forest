# 🌳 Random Forest – Ensemble Learning Model

## 📄 Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Random Forest algorithm**, one of the most powerful and widely used ensemble learning methods in machine learning.  
Random Forest combines multiple decision trees to form a robust model that improves accuracy, reduces overfitting, and handles both classification and regression tasks effectively.

The notebook includes steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation, showcasing how ensemble models outperform individual decision trees.
